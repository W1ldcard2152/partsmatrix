# eBay Marketplace Account Deletion Compliance Implementation

## Summary

I've implemented a complete eBay Marketplace Account Deletion compliance solution for your Parts Matrix project. This is **required** by eBay for all developers using their APIs, including your eBay parts extractor.

## What Was Created

### 1. Django App: `apps/ebay_notifications`
- **Models**: Database tables to store configurations and log deletion requests
- **Views**: Endpoint that handles eBay challenge verification and deletion notifications
- **Admin**: Django admin interface to monitor all deletion requests
- **Management Commands**: Easy setup and testing tools

### 2. Database Models

#### `EbayNotificationConfig`
- Stores your endpoint URL and verification token
- Only one active configuration at a time

#### `EbayAccountDeletionLog`
- Logs every deletion notification received from eBay
- Tracks processing status and what data was deleted
- Indexed for fast searching by username, user ID, dates

### 3. API Endpoint
```
/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/
```

**GET Requests**: Handles eBay challenge code verification during setup
**POST Requests**: Receives actual account deletion notifications

### 4. Management Commands

#### Setup Configuration
```bash
python manage.py setup_ebay_notifications --endpoint-url https://yourdomain.com/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/ --generate-token
```

#### Test Endpoint
```bash
python manage.py test_ebay_endpoint --challenge-code test123
python manage.py test_ebay_endpoint --send-notification
```

#### Show Configuration
```bash
python manage.py show_ebay_config
```

### 5. Batch Setup Script
`setup_ebay_compliance.bat` - Walks through the entire setup process

## How It Works

### Challenge Verification (Setup)
1. You configure endpoint URL and verification token
2. You enter these in eBay Developer Portal
3. eBay sends: `GET /ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/?challenge_code=abc123`
4. Endpoint calculates: `SHA256(challengeCode + verificationToken + endpointUrl)`
5. Returns: `{"challengeResponse": "hash_value"}`
6. eBay verifies the hash and activates notifications

### Account Deletion Notifications (Production)
1. eBay user requests account deletion
2. eBay sends POST with user details (username, userID, eiasToken)
3. Endpoint immediately responds with HTTP 200 (required)
4. Logs the notification in database
5. Processes any data deletion (minimal for parts database)
6. Marks notification as processed

## Legal Compliance

### ‚úÖ What We Do
- **Immediate acknowledgment**: HTTP 200 response within seconds
- **Complete logging**: Every notification is recorded with full details
- **Data processing**: Check for and remove any eBay user data
- **Admin monitoring**: Track all deletions through Django admin
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of malformed requests

### ‚úÖ What We Store
Since this is a parts interchange database, we primarily store:
- Parts data (public information)
- Vehicle compatibility (public information)  
- Manufacturer information (public information)

We typically do NOT store eBay user personal data, so deletion mainly involves logging compliance.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Compliance Requirements
- **Response time**: Must acknowledge within seconds (‚úÖ implemented)
- **Data deletion**: Must remove user data if any exists (‚úÖ implemented)
- **Logging**: Must keep records for audit purposes (‚úÖ implemented)
- **Monitoring**: Must respond to eBay alerts if endpoint fails (‚úÖ email alerts configured)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Run the Setup Script
```bash
setup_ebay_compliance.bat
```

OR manually:

### 2. Apply Database Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 3. Configure Endpoint
```bash
python manage.py setup_ebay_notifications --endpoint-url https://yourdomain.com/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/ --generate-token
```

### 4. Test (Optional)
```bash
python manage.py test_ebay_endpoint --challenge-code test123
python manage.py test_ebay_endpoint --send-notification
```

### 5. Configure eBay Developer Portal
1. Go to https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys
2. Click "Notifications" next to your App ID
3. Select "Marketplace Account Deletion" radio button
4. Enter alert email address
5. Copy/paste endpoint URL and verification token from step 3
6. Click "Save" - eBay will immediately test your endpoint

### 6. Monitor in Django Admin
Go to `/admin/ebay_notifications/` to:
- View all deletion notifications received
- Check processing status
- Search by username or user ID
- Monitor for any errors

## Configuration Updates Made

### 1. Django Settings (`settings.py`)
- Added `'apps.ebay_notifications'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`

### 2. URL Configuration (`urls.py`)  
- Added `path('ebay/', include('apps.ebay_notifications.urls'))`

## Security & Performance

### ‚úÖ Security Features
- HTTPS required (eBay requirement)
- Input validation on all requests
- Token-based verification system
- No authentication bypass (endpoint is public as required)
- Proper error handling without exposing internals

### ‚úÖ Performance Features
- Immediate HTTP 200 response (compliance requirement)
- Efficient database indexing
- Minimal processing during acknowledgment
- Background processing capability (can be extended with Celery)
- Duplicate notification detection

## Expected Volume

According to eBay documentation, expect up to **1,500 notifications per day** during peak periods. The implementation is designed to handle this volume efficiently.

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Django Admin Dashboard
- Real-time view of all deletion requests
- Processing status tracking
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Date-based browsing

### Email Alerts
eBay will send email alerts if your endpoint:
- Doesn't respond within 24 hours
- Returns error status codes
- Becomes unreachable

### Logging
All activity is logged through Django's logging system:
- Successful challenge verifications
- Received deletion notifications  
- Processing completion
- Error conditions

## Next Steps

1. **Run the setup**: Use `setup_ebay_compliance.bat` or manual commands
2. **Test locally**: Verify endpoints work before going to eBay portal
3. **Deploy to production**: Ensure HTTPS and public accessibility
4. **Configure eBay portal**: Enter endpoint URL and verification token
5. **Monitor**: Check Django admin regularly for notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Configuration not found" error**
```bash
python manage.py setup_ebay_notifications --endpoint-url https://yourdomain.com/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/ --generate-token
```

**Challenge verification fails**
- Check endpoint URL matches exactly
- Verify verification token is correct
- Ensure HTTPS is working
- Test with management command first

**Notifications not received**
- Verify eBay portal subscription is active
- Check endpoint is publicly accessible
- Review Django logs for errors
- Test with the notification test command

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Show current configuration
python manage.py show_ebay_config

# Test challenge verification
python manage.py test_ebay_endpoint --challenge-code test123

# Test deletion notification processing
python manage.py test_ebay_endpoint --send-notification

# Check if endpoint is accessible externally
curl "https://yourdomain.com/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/?challenge_code=test"
```

## Compliance Status

‚úÖ **Challenge Verification**: Implemented per eBay specifications
‚úÖ **Notification Receipt**: Handles POST requests with proper acknowledgment
‚úÖ **Data Logging**: All notifications stored with full audit trail
‚úÖ **Data Processing**: Minimal deletion (appropriate for parts database)
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of all error conditions
‚úÖ **Security**: HTTPS required, proper validation
‚úÖ **Performance**: Fast response times, efficient processing
‚úÖ **Monitoring**: Django admin dashboard and logging
‚úÖ **Documentation**: Complete setup and usage documentation

## Legal Notes

This implementation satisfies eBay's legal requirements for marketplace account deletion compliance. Since your Parts Matrix application primarily stores parts interchange data (not eBay user personal data), the deletion processing is minimal but compliant.

**Important**: Keep this system running and monitored. Failure to acknowledge eBay deletion notifications can result in termination of your API access.

The system is designed to be:
- **Legally compliant** with eBay requirements
- **Technically robust** with proper error handling
- **Easy to monitor** through Django admin
- **Simple to maintain** with clear documentation
- **Scalable** for high notification volumes

You're now ready to meet eBay's marketplace account deletion compliance requirements! üéâ
