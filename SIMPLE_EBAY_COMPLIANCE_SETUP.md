# eBay Compliance - Simple Website Integration

## Overview

Instead of using ngrok, you can host the eBay Marketplace Account Deletion compliance endpoint directly on your existing website. This is much simpler and more reliable for production use.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Configure Your Domain

Add your domain to Django's ALLOWED_HOSTS:

```python
# In your .env file or settings
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com,localhost,127.0.0.1
```

### 2. Set Up eBay Compliance Endpoint

Your Django app already has the eBay compliance code in `apps/ebay_notifications`. You just need to configure it with your real domain:

```bash
# Configure with your actual domain
python manage.py setup_ebay_notifications \
  --endpoint-url https://yourdomain.com/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/ \
  --generate-token
```

### 3. Deploy to Your Website

Deploy your Django app to your hosting provider (Render, Heroku, etc.) with the eBay notifications app included.

### 4. Configure eBay Developer Portal

1. Go to: https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys
2. Click "Notifications" next to your App ID
3. Select "Marketplace Account Deletion" radio button
4. Enter an alert email address and click Save
5. Enter your endpoint URL: `https://yourdomain.com/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/`
6. Enter the verification token from step 2
7. Click Save - eBay will test your endpoint

### 5. Test Your Endpoint

```bash
# Test challenge verification
python manage.py test_ebay_endpoint --challenge-code test123

# Test deletion notification
python manage.py test_ebay_endpoint --send-notification

# Test externally
curl "https://yourdomain.com/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/?challenge_code=test123"
```

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Simple** - No ngrok complexity
✅ **Reliable** - No URL changes or session limits
✅ **Production-ready** - Runs on your actual infrastructure
✅ **Secure** - Uses your existing SSL certificate
✅ **Permanent** - No need to update eBay portal

## Monitoring

- **Django Admin**: https://yourdomain.com/admin/ebay_notifications/
- **Endpoint**: https://yourdomain.com/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/
- **All deletion requests** are automatically logged and processed

## What's Already Built

Your Django project already includes:
- ✅ Complete eBay compliance endpoint (`apps/ebay_notifications`)
- ✅ Challenge code verification
- ✅ Account deletion notification handling
- ✅ Django admin interface for monitoring
- ✅ Management commands for setup and testing
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Configure for your domain
python manage.py setup_ebay_notifications --endpoint-url https://yourdomain.com/ebay/marketplace-account-deletion/ --generate-token

# Show current config
python manage.py show_ebay_config

# Test endpoint
python manage.py test_ebay_endpoint --challenge-code test123
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add your domain** to ALLOWED_HOSTS
2. **Deploy your Django app** to your hosting
3. **Configure the endpoint** with your real domain
4. **Set up eBay Developer Portal** with your endpoint
5. **Start collecting eBay data** legally!

This approach is much cleaner and doesn't require any of the ngrok complexity. Your eBay compliance will run reliably on your existing infrastructure.
